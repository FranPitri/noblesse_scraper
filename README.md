## What's this?

A simple command-line application to scrape Noblesse Webtoon series chapters (from unofficial sources). I made it entirely for personal purposes, but hey if it's useful to you as well then that's great.

## How to run?

ðŸ“Œ Using docker:

```sh
docker build -t noblesse_scraper .
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app/output noblesse_scraper -o output [OPTIONS]
```

ðŸ“Œ Using the pre-compiled binary from releases:

Just do that lol. It's only available for Linux though.
